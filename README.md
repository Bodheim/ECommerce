## Description

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.
My task was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
